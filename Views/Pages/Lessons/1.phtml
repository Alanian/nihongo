<?= $global->lessonHeader('Particles'); ?>
<p>
    In Japanese, there are grammatical elements that are called <strong>particles</strong>.
    These particles decide, in which way words should be understood or interpreted.
    There are few of these, but they can have multiple functions.
    Particles always follow a word but <strong>never precede</strong> it.
