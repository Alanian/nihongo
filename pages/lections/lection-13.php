<h1>Lection <?= $_GET['lection']; ?> - Translation</h1>
<p>
    Even though romance languages (Italian, Spanish, French, etc.) have the same ancestor (Latin) you can't translate
    them one-to-one because they developed independently. Individual situations needed individual language
    constructions and meanings. Some expressions don't make sense if you translate them word-by-word. Hence you can't
    translate a language in another without losing meaning, accentuation and emotions.

    Well, you can't expect to find a perfect translation for such an exotic language as Japanese. What you can do is to
    use correspondence, i.e. equivalent expressions.

    An example is the form of address. <em>Kobayashi-san</em> is translated as "Mr. Kobayashi", and here's nothing bad
    about it, it's a recognized translation. However <em>san</em> is not a translation for "Mr." or "Mrs.", it's an
    equivalence. The Japanese have another system for addressing people, it's based on the respect level they give to a
    person. Coincidentally <em>san</em>'s respect level is almost equal to "Mr." or "Mrs.", but there are much more, so
    how do you translate them?
</p>
<p>
    Another example is that you can't say "bless you" in Japanese, because the idea (to say anything if someone sneezes)
    has never got in mind.
