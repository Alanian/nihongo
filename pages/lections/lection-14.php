<h1>Lection <?= $_GET['lection']; ?> - Verb Agglutination</h1>
<p>
    In english you use words as prepositions to bring sense in.<br>
    - You <strong>do not</strong> eat mushrooms.<br>
    - We <strong>want to</strong> eat mushrooms<br>
    - She <strong>should</strong> eat mushrooms.<br>
    In japanese such prepositions don't exist. They use affixes or sub-forms on the verb. However these affixes can't be
    simply added to the verb, because the verb form and the sub-form have to be made "compatible" first
    (see <a href="lections.php?lection=7">Lection 7</a>).

    Maybe you remember Dominoes, that old tile-based game from your childhood. Although you don't know them, you will
    understand the concept very easily. In our metaphor tough let's assume, blank sides are terminating/unchangeable and
    can't combine with another blank ones.<br>
</p>
<p>
    A verb contains of a stem and an ending. Something like this: <span class="domino">🀵</span><br>
    Affixes/sub-forms can be double-sided <span class="domino">🀻</span> or terminate <span class="domino">🁔</span><br>
    You surely had figured out that <span class="domino">🀵</span> and <span class="domino">🀻</span> don't fit.<br>
    What you can do is to transform the verb's ending from <span class="domino">🀵</span> to
    <span class="domino">🀲</span><br>
    Now you have <span class="domino">🀲🀻</span> and need to change the ending from the sub-form to
    <span class="domino">🀽</span><br>
    And you get <span class="domino">🀲🀽🁔</span>
</p>
<p>
    The last tile don't has to be a terminating tile, because all tiles can terminate. They also can be as long as
    possible until they met a terminating tile.<br>
    <span class="domino">🀲🀽🁖🁃🁓</span> and <span class="domino">🀲🀽🁖🁃🁍</span> are possible.
