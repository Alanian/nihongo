<h1>Lection <?= $_GET['lection'];?> - Irregularity</h1>
<p>
    The structure of a language is never planned, it develops of its own.
    Grammar wasn't <strong>created</strong>, but it was <strong>found</strong> by researchers a long time after its
    development. A language that is created mustn't have any irregularities.
</p>
<p>
    Because of japanese grammatical structure there is hardly ever something irregular.
    And that's the easy thing about it, you can use formulas, that are always true.
</p>
<p>
    There are enough cases in that you can find an <strong>exception</strong> in the rule, but its actually no
    exception, because there <strong>isn't such rule</strong> that confirms that exception.
