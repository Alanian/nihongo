    The <strong>Terminal Form</strong> is one of seven word-forms. In different books and explanations, there
    are differences in number and names of these forms. We're going to have seven, and they will be referenced by their
    names rather than their meaning, so please remember these fancy names well.

    Japanese words actually haven't a basic form, a word is always in a special form.
    Without a basic form (infinitive) it's more difficult to explain things because there is no root that can be relied
    on. Luckily, people who are responsible for education made the
    <em>Shūshikei<meaning>Terminal Form</meaning></em>
    (SSK) the dictionary form.

    A sentence always ends with the predicate (i.e. the main statement of the sentence), that means the predicate
    must be in the terminal form. Naturally, only verbs and adjectives can get their ending transformed.
