<h1>Lection <?= $_GET['lection']; ?> - Verbs SSK</h1>
<p>
    There's not much to add to the explanation from <a href="lections.php?lection=5">Lection 5</a>, we already covered
    almost anything. You should remember following separation, because it will be important for other word forms.
</p>
<p>
    A verb contains a stem and an ending. The ending is the last mora of the verb. Anything until that is the stem.
    Get a look on <jap>わすれる<meaning>to forget</meaning></jap>. The stem is <jap>わすれ</jap> and the ending is
    <jap>る</jap>. Remember, that the stem can <strong>never</strong> be transformed.
</p>
<p>
    A verb in the SSK always ends with a mora from the u-column. Hence, every verb you've seen so far was was in its
    SSK. Easy, right?
