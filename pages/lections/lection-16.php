<h1>Lection <?= $_GET['lection']; ?> - <em>masu</em>-form</h1>
<p>
    Japanese has a very complicated politeness-system with several levels, relationships and forms. The
    <em>masu</em>-form is the common one, which is used in everyday conversation. I'm afraid you can't translate it into
    english, but not to use it makes you a rude or vulgar person, so use it while you speak to a person you should
    respect.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>masu</em>-form is appended to a verb in the RYK, exactly the predicate, other verbs in a sentence must not
    be in this form. Formula: verb[RYK] + <em>masu</em>

    This form is not about <strong>what</strong> you tell, but <strong>to whom</strong> you speak. Even if you speak
    about crap, you should be polite if you speak to a professor.
