<h1>Lesson <?= $_GET['lesson']; ?> - Particles</h1>
<p>
    In Japanese, there are grammatical elements that are called <strong>particles</strong>.
    These particles decide, in which way words should be understood or interpreted.
    There are not few of these, but they can have more than one meaning.
    Particles always follow a word but never precede it.
